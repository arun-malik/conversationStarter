# conversationStarter
This project was created for Skype Hackathon. 
 
## Idea: Conversation Starter Bot 

* Summary: 
          * Chat with bot and ask how should i start conversation with friends. (not in touch with friends for a long time)
          * Bot will search for friends social media (facebook, twitter, linked) and collect information like last checked-in, likes, shared posts, tweets etc and help you frame conversation starters.
          * e.g: 
              * Ask Akshay about his recent trip to Rocky Mountains
              * Ask Prachi about her thoughts on new Iphone &
* Bugs: 
        * Bot is not functional 
        * Was not able to connect FB apis, Created a rest api to get tweets based on user name
        
* Challenges: 
        * how to identify fb user name,  linked contact and twitter handle if all are different for user's friends
